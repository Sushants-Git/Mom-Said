# Mom Said üó∫Ô∏èüì±

Mom Said is a location-based reminder app that helps you remember tasks your mom (or anyone else) asked you to do when you're near a specific location. Never forget to pick up groceries or run errands again!

## Features ‚ú®

- Add location-based reminders
- Set time ranges for reminders
- Receive notifications when you're near the specified location
- Delete completed tasks

## How It Works

1. Add a new reminder by clicking the "+" button
2. Enter the task details (e.g., "buy vegetables and shoes")
3. Select the location on the map where you need to complete the task
4. Set a time range for when you want to receive reminders (optional)
5. When you're near the specified location, you'll receive a notification reminding you of the task

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
